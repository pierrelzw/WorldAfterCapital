# Plan of Attack 

My first major claim is that capital, at least in the technological sense, is no longer scarce. We have sufficient productive capital to meet our needs through growing food, constructing buildings, producing clothes, and so on. To establish this, I will start by setting out a catalog of individual and collective needs. I will then examine current population trends to see what we can learn about the future growth in these needs, followed by an evaluation of our available capital and its ability to meet those needs. That entire section of *The World After Capital* shows that physical capital is sufficient in aggregate. It does not address questions of wealth distribution, which will be discussed later.


我的第一个主要主张是，资本，至少从技术层面看，已经不再稀缺。我们有足够的生产性资本，可以通过种植食物、建造建筑、生产衣服等来满足我们的需求。为了确定这一点，我将首先列出一份个体和集体的需求目录。然后，我将研究当前的人口趋势来看看上述需求的未来增长，以及我们能从中了解到什么。接着，我会评估我们可用的资本及其满足这些需求的能力。《后资本世界》将展示：物质资本在总体上是充足的。这本书没有涉及财富分配的问题，我们以后会讨论。

My second claim is that attention is now the key scarcity, meaning that our present allocation of attention is resulting in humanity’s needs not being met. To establish this I will start by pinning down more precisely what attention is and presenting several examples of human needs that either are already no longer met, such as the need for meaning, or that are at risk of not being met in the future, such as calories due to the climate crisis—all due to a lack of attention. After that I will consider how much human attention is currently caught up in Industrial Age activities, and how more attention is being trapped through the dominant uses of digital technology, such as advertising-based social networks. I will also discuss why market-based capitalism cannot be used to allocate attention.

我的第二个主张是，现代社会最稀缺的是注意力。也就是说，我们注意力分配正在导致人类的需求得不到满足。为了明确这一点，首先，我将更精确地定义 “什么是注意力”，并列举几个人类的需求的例子，这些需求要么已经不再被满足，比如对人生意义的需求，要么在未来有可能无法被满足，比如气候危机导致的能量需求，所有这些都是由于当下人类缺乏注意力造成的。然后，我将探讨，目前有多少人类注意力被卷入中工业时代的活动中，以及更多的注意力是如何通过使用当下更具主导地位的数字技术被困住的，比如基于广告的社交网络。我还将讨论为什么基于市场机制的资本主义不能被用来（更好地）分配注意力。


I will then make concrete suggestions for how to facilitate the transition to the next age, which I call the Knowledge Age. In keeping with the ideas about knowledge and humanism that I presented earlier, my suggestions focus on increasing freedoms as the basis for more available attention and improved allocation of that attention.

然后，我将就如何推动向下一个时代（我称之为知识时代）的过渡提出具体的建议。为了与我之前提出的关于知识和人文主义的想法保持一致，我的建议将聚焦于 “增加自由”，这将作为获得更多可用注意力和改进注意力分配的基础。
