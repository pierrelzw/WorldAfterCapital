# Humanism

What are the values that I am basing all this on, and where do they come from? In his book *Sapiens*, the historian Yuval Noah Harari claims that all value systems are based on equally valid subjective narratives. He denies that there is an objective basis for humanism to support a privileged position for humanity as a species, but here I will try to convince you that he is wrong (Harari, 2011). For not only is the power of knowledge a source of optimism; its very existence provides the basis for humanism. By “humanism” I mean a system of values that centers on human agency and responsibility rather than on the divine or the supernatural, and that embraces the process of critical inquiry as the central enabler of progress.

我所依据的价值观是什么，它们来自哪里？历史学家尤瓦尔·诺亚·哈拉里（Yuval Noah Harari）在他的《*Sapiens*》一书中声称，所有的价值体系都是基于同样有效的主观叙述。他否认人文主义有客观基础支持人类作为一个物种的特权地位，但在这里我将试图说服你，他是错误的（Harari, 2011）。因为知识的力量不仅是乐观主义的来源；它的存在本身就为人文主义提供了基础。我所说的 “人文主义” 是指一种价值观体系，它以人类的能动性和责任为中心，而不是以神性或超自然为中心，并将批判性探究的过程作为进步的核心推动力。


Knowledge, as I have already defined it, is the externalized information that allows humans to share insights with each other. It includes both scientific and artistic knowledge. Again, we are the only species on Earth that generates this kind of knowledge, with the ability to share it over space and time. I am able to read a book today that someone else wrote a long time ago and in a completely different part of the world.

知识，正如我已经定义的那样，是使人类能够相互分享见解的外化信息。它包括科学和艺术知识。并且，我们是地球上唯一产生、并有能力跨越空间和时间分享这种知识的物种。比如我今天能够读到一本别人在很久以前写的书，而且是在世界一个完全不同的地方。


This matters a great deal, because knowledge enables fundamentally different modes of problem solving and progress. Humans can select and combine knowledge created by other humans, allowing small changes to accrete into large bodies of work over time, which in turn provide the basis for scientific and artistic breakthroughs. Without knowledge, other species have only two methods of sharing things they have learned: communication and evolution. Communication is local and ephemeral, and evolution is extremely slow. As a result, animals and plants routinely encounter problems that they cannot solve, resulting in disease, death and even extinction. Many of these problems today are caused by humans (more on that shortly).

这一点非常重要，因为知识使问题的解决和（人类的/社会的）进步有了一种从根本上与之前不同的方式。人类可以选择和结合其他人类创造的知识，随着时间的推移，一些小的变化累积成大的作品，这反过来又为科学和艺术的突破提供了基础。而没有知识的其他物种，只有两种方法来分享他们学到的东西：交流和进化。沟通是局部的和短暂的，而进化是极其缓慢的。因此，动物和植物经常会遇到它们无法解决的问题，进而导致疾病、死亡甚至灭绝。当然，今天的许多问题都是由人类造成的（稍后会有更多的介绍）。


Knowledge has given humanity great power. We can fly in the sky, we can sail the seas, travel fast on land, build large and durable structures, and so on. The power of our knowledge is reshaping the Earth. It often does so in ways that solve one set of problems while creating an entirely new set of problems, not just for humans but for other species. This is why it is crucial that we remember what the story of Spiderman tells us: “With great power comes great responsibility.” It is because of knowledge that humans are responsible for looking after dolphins, rather than the other way round. 

知识给了人类巨大的力量。我们可以在天上飞，我们可以在海上航行，在陆地上快速旅行，建造大型和耐用的建筑，等等。我们所拥有的知识的力量正在重新塑造地球。它经常以这样的方式运行，解决一系列问题的同时创造出一系列新的问题，不仅是人类自己的问题，也是对其他物种的问题。这就是为什么我们要记住蜘蛛侠的故事的那句：“能力越大，责任越大”。正是因为有了知识，人类才有责任照顾海豚，而不是反过来。


Progress and knowledge are inherently linked through critical inquiry: we can only make progress if we are capable of identifying some ideas as better than others. Critical inquiry is by no means linear—new ideas are not always better than old ones. Sometimes we go off in the wrong direction. Still, given enough time, a sorting takes place. For instance, we no longer believe in the geocentric view of our solar system, and only a tiny fraction of the art that has ever been created is still considered important. While this process may take decades or even centuries, it is blindingly fast compared to biological evolution. 

进步和知识通过独立思考内在地联系在一起：只有当我们有能力比其他人更好地定义一些想法时，我们才能取得进步。独立思考绝不是线性的 —— 新思想不一定比旧思想好。有时我们会在错误的方向上走下去。当然，如果有足够长的时间去检验，新思想还是相对更可取的。例如，我们不再相信太阳系的地心说，只有一小部分曾经创造过的艺术仍然被认为是重要的。虽然这个过程可能需要几十年甚至几个世纪，但与生物进化相比，它的速度无疑是快很多的。


My use of the word “better” implies the existence of universal values. All of these flow from the recognition of the power of human knowledge and the responsibility which directly attaches to that power. And the central value is the process of critical inquiry itself. We must be vigilant in pointing out flaws in existing knowledge and proposing alternatives. After all, imagine how impoverished our music would be if we had banned all new compositions after Beethoven. 

我使用的 “更好” 一词意味着普世价值的存在。所有这些都来自于对两种事物的认识 —— 人类的知识的力量和直接与这种力量相联系的责任。而核心价值是独立思考的过程本身。我们必须警惕地指出现有知识的缺陷并提出替代方案【？】。毕竟，想象一下，如果我们禁止贝多芬之后的所有新作品，我们的音乐将是多么的贫乏。


We should thus seek regulation and self-regulation that supports critical inquiry, in the broad sense of processes that weed out bad ideas and help better ones to propagate. In business this often takes the form of market competition, which is why regulation that supports competitive markets is so important. Individually, critical inquiry requires us to be open to receiving feedback in the face of our deeply rooted tendency toward confirmation bias. In politics and government, critical inquiry is enabled by the democratic process. 

因此，我们应该探索支持独立思考的社会规则和自我约束规则，从广义上讲，就是能够剔除坏想法并帮助更好的想法传播的方法。在商业中，我们往往采取市场竞争的形式，这就是为什么支持竞争性市场的社会（监管）规则如此重要。就个体而言，独立思考要求我们在面对我们根深蒂固的偏见时，能够以开放的态度接收反馈。在政治和政府中，独立思考式的调查是由民主进程促成的。


Freedom of speech is not a value in and of itself; rather, it is a crucial enabler of critical inquiry. But we can see how some limits on free speech might flow from the same value. If you can use speech to call for violence against individuals or minority groups, you can also use it to suppress critical inquiry. 

言论自由本身并不是一种价值；相反，它是独立思考探究的重要助力。但我们可以看到对言论自由的一些限制是如何从同一价值中产生的【？】。如果你可以利用言论来煽动对个人或少数群体的暴力，你也可以利用它来压制对独立思考的探索。


Digital technology, including a global information network and the general-purpose computing that is bringing machine intelligence, are dramatically accelerating the rate at which humanity can accumulate and share knowledge. However, these same technologies also allow targeted manipulation and propaganda on a global scale, as well as constant distraction, both of which undermine the evaluation and creation of knowledge. Digital technology thus massively increases the importance of critical inquiry, which is central to knowledge-based humanism. 

数字技术，包括全球信息网络和带来机器智能的通用计算，正在极大地加快人类积累和分享知识的速度。然而，这些技术也允许在全球范围内进行有针对性的操纵和宣传，以及不断地分散注意力，这两者都破坏了知识的评估和创造。因此，数字技术极大地增加了独立思考探究的重要性，而独立思考探究是以知识为基础的人文主义的核心。


Beyond critical inquiry, optimism and responsibility, other humanist values are also rooted in the existence of knowledge. One of these is solidarity. There are nearly 8 billion human beings living on Earth, which exists in an otherwise inhospitable solar system. The big problems that humanity faces, such as infectious diseases and the climate crisis, require our combined efforts and will impact all of us. We thus need to support each other, irrespective of such differences as gender, race or nationality. Whatever our superficial differences may be, we are much more like each other—because of knowledge—than we are to any other species.

除了独立思考探究、乐观主义和责任感，其他人文主义价值观也植根于知识的存在。比如团结互助。有近 80 亿人生活在地球上，而地球存在于一个原本荒凉的太阳系中。人类面临的大问题，如传染病和气候危机，一方面需要我们共同努力来解决，另一方面，也将影响全人类。因此，我们需要相互支持，而不考虑性别、种族或国籍等差异。无论我们的表观差异是什么，我们彼此之间的相似性 —— 因为知识 —— 比我们与其他任何物种的相似性要大得多。


Once we have established a shared commitment to the value of solidarity, we can celebrate diversity as another humanist value. In current political debates we often pit individuality against the collective as if it the two conflicted. However, to modernize John Donne, no human is an island—we are all part of societies, and of humanity at large. By recognizing the importance of our common humanity, we create the basis on which we can unfold as individuals. Solidarity allows us to celebrate, rather than fear, the diversity of the human species.


一旦我们对团结互助的价值建立了统一认知和实践承诺，我们就可以庆祝了，因为多样性将变为一种新的人文主义价值。在当前的政治竞争环境下，我们经常将个体与集体对立起来，似乎两者之间存在冲突。然而，用约翰-多恩的话说，没有人是一座孤岛，我们都是社会的一部分，也是整个人类的一部分。通过建立对人类共同体的重要性的认知，我们创造了一个个体与集体利益一致的基础。“团结互助” 使我们能够庆幸，而不是害怕人类的多样性。
