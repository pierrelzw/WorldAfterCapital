# Attention Trapped in Industrial Age Activities
 
While digital technology is being used to capture rapidly increasing amounts of our attention, we should also consider what the bulk of attention is dedicated to today. Not surprisingly, since we are just beginning to transition out of it, the vast bulk of human attention is focused on Industrial Age activities, in particular labor and consumption. For example, in the US many people spend 40 or more hours a week on the job, which amounts to 35 per cent of waking hours (assuming eight hours of sleep per night). People in the US now spend around 10 and a half hours a day consuming media (including traditional television and radio in addition to Facebook, YouTube, Netflix and similar services, podcasts, games, and more), which (setting aside simultaneous usage) amounts to over 60 per cent of waking time ("The Nielsen Total Audience Report," 2020). To understand why so much of our attention is spoken for, I present the concept of the “job loop.”

虽然数字技术被用来捕捉我们迅速增加的注意力，但我们也应该考虑今天大部分的注意力都用在什么地方。不足为奇的是，由于我们刚刚开始向工业时代过渡，人类的大部分注意力都集中在工业时代的活动上，尤其是劳动和消费。例如，在美国，许多人每周花 40 小时或更多的时间在工作上，这相当于清醒时间的 35%（假设每晚有 8 小时的睡眠）。美国人现在每天花大约 10 个半小时消费媒体（除了 Facebook、YouTube、Netflix 和类似服务、播客、游戏等，还包括传统的电视和广播），这（抛开同时使用的情况）相当于清醒时间的 60% 以上（“尼尔森总受众报告”，2020）。为了理解为什么我们有这么多的注意力被锁定了，我提出了 “工作循环” 的概念。



## The Job Loop

Thinking dispassionately about labor is hard, because over the last couple of centuries we have become convinced that employment is essential to both the economy and individual dignity. Let’s start from the perspective of production. If you want to make products or deliver a service, you require a series of inputs, including buildings and machines (capital), raw materials or parts (supplies), and human workers (labor). For much of history, capital and labor have been complementary: as the owner of a company, you couldn’t use your physical capital without having labor to operate it. That was true for manufacturing and even more so for services, which often use little capital and consist primarily of labor.

冷静地思考劳动问题是很难的，因为在过去的几个世纪中，我们已经确信就业对经济和个人尊严都是至关重要的。让我们从生产的角度开始。如果你想制造产品或提供服务，你需要一系列的投入，包括建筑物和机器（资本），原材料或零件（用品），以及人类工人（劳动）。在历史上的大部分时间里，资本和劳动是互补的：作为一个公司的所有者，如果没有劳动力来操作，你就无法使用你的物质资本。制造业如此，服务行业更是如此，因为服务行业往往很少使用资本，主要由劳动力组成。

 
However, there is nothing in economics that says that all production processes should require labor. The opposite idea is an artifact of the production functions that were technologically available when economists developed the theory of production. If company owners are able to figure out how to do something cheaper or better by using less or no labor, that’s what they will choose to do. When it was acquired by Facebook for $19 billion, for example, WhatsApp had fewer than 50 employees. 

然而，经济学中没有任何内容说所有的生产过程都应该需要劳动力。当经济学家发展生产理论时，人们探索出了一种技术上可行的生产模式：如果公司老板能够想出如何通过使用更少或不使用劳动力来做更便宜或更好的事情，这就是他们会选择做的事情。例如，当 WhatsApp 被 Facebook 以 190 亿美元收购时，它的员工不到 50 人。


Having no labor at all might make sense for a single company, but it does not for the economy as a whole as it is currently constructed. Who will buy goods and services produced by automated systems if people are unemployed and don’t have any money? Walter Reuther, head of the United Automobile Workers union in the 1950s, often told a story about an exchange he had with an official of the Ford motor company (who, as the story became famous in its own right, became Henry Ford II): 

完全没有劳动力可能对单个公司有意义，但对目前构建的整个经济来说是没有意义的。如果人们失业，没有钱，谁会购买自动化系统生产的商品和服务？沃尔特·卢瑟是 20 世纪 50 年代联合汽车工人工会的负责人，他经常讲一个故事，讲的是他与福特汽车公司的一位官员（由于这个故事本身就很有名，他成为亨利·福特二世）的谈话：

> Ford official: How are you going to collect union dues from these guys [robots]?
> 福特官员：你打算如何向这些家伙「机器人」收取工会会费？

> Walter Reuther: How are you going to get them to buy Fords? (O'Toole, 2011)

> 沃尔特·卢瑟。你打算如何让他们购买福特汽车？(O'Toole, 2011)

If we all had inherited wealth or sufficient income from capital, an economy without labor would not be a problem, and we could enjoy the benefits of cheaper products and services courtesy of robots and automation. 

如果我们都有继承的财富或足够的资本收入，没有劳动力的经济将不是一个问题，我们可以享受机器人和自动化带来的更便宜的产品和服务的好处。


The possibility of a slump in consumer demand due to less labor long seemed not just unlikely but impossible. There was a virtuous loop at the heart of economic growth: the ‘job loop.’ 

由于劳动力减少而导致消费需求下滑的可能性似乎不仅仅是不可能的，而且是不可能的。经济增长的核心是一个良性循环："就业循环"。


In today’s economy, the majority of people sell their labor, producing goods and services and receiving wages in return. With their wages, they buy smartphones, books, tools, houses and cars. They also buy the professional assistance of attorneys, doctors, car mechanics, gardeners and hair stylists.

在今天的经济中，大多数人出售他们的劳动，生产商品和服务，并获得工资作为回报。他们用自己的工资购买智能手机、书籍、工具、房屋和汽车。他们还购买了律师、医生、汽车修理工、园艺师和发型师的专业协助。


Most of the people who sell these goods and services are in turn employed, meaning that they too sell their labor and buy goods and services from other people with what they are paid. And round and round it goes.

大多数出售这些商品和服务的人反过来也被雇用，这意味着他们也出售自己的劳动力，用他们的报酬从其他人那里购买商品和服务。就这样周而复始。

The job loop worked incredibly well in combination with competitive markets for goods and services and with a properly functioning financial system. Entrepreneurs either used debt or equity to start new businesses, and employed people at wages that were often higher than older businesses, increasing their employees’ purchasing power and thereby fueling further innovation and growth. As far as expanding economic production and solving problems for which markets are well-suited, it was a virtuous cycle that resulted in unprecedented prosperity and innovation.

在商品和服务的竞争性市场以及正常运作的金融系统的配合下，就业循环的效果令人难以置信。企业家们利用债务或股权开办新企业，并以通常高于老企业的工资雇用员工，增加员工的购买力，从而推动进一步的创新和增长。就扩大经济生产和解决市场很适合的问题而言，这是一个良性循环，带来了前所未有的繁荣和创新。

 
Some might point out that many people these days are self-employed, but that is irrelevant if they are selling their time. For instance, a graphic designer who works as an independent contractor is still paid for the labor they put into a project. It is only if they design something that is paid for over and over without them spending further time on it, such as a graphics template, that they have the opportunity to leave the job loop.

有些人可能会指出，现在很多人都是自营职业者，但如果他们是在出售自己的时间，这就不重要了。例如，作为独立承包商的平面设计师仍然要为他们在项目中投入的劳动付出代价。只有当他们设计的东西被反复支付，而他们没有在上面花费更多的时间时，例如图形模板，他们才有机会离开这个工作圈。


There are multiple problems with this virtuous cycle today. First, as we calculated at the outset of this section, it traps the vast majority of human attention. Second, when things contract, the effect of mutual reinforcement applies in the other direction. Take a small town, for example, in which local stores provide some of the employment. If a big superstore comes into town, total retail employment and wages will both fall. Fewer store employees have income, and those who do have less. If they start to spend less on haircuts and car repairs, the hair stylist and car mechanic earn less and can spend less themselves, and so on. Third, much of the consumption today is driven by vast sums of money spent on advertising, as well as by exposure to social media, inducing people into positional spending on wants (e.g., a bigger car than their neighbor). These higher expenditure levels, in turn, lock people into jobs which they hate but cannot afford to leave, which explains a great deal of the frustration among relatively highly-paid professionals, such as lawyers and bankers.

今天，这种良性循环存在着多种问题。首先，正如我们在本节开始时计算的那样，它困住了人类绝大部分的注意力。第二，当事物收缩时，相互强化的效果在另一个方向上适用。以一个小镇为例，当地的商店提供了一些就业机会。如果一家大型超级市场进入小镇，零售业的总就业人数和工资都会下降。更少的商店员工有收入，而那些有收入的人则更少。如果他们开始减少在理发和修车上的消费，那么发型师和修车工的收入就会减少，他们自己也可以减少消费，如此循环。第三，今天的大部分消费是由花在广告上的巨额资金以及对社会媒体的接触所驱动的，诱使人们对需求进行定位消费（例如，比邻居更大的汽车）。这些较高的支出水平反过来又将人们锁定在他们讨厌但又无力离开的工作中，这就解释了相对高薪的专业人士，如律师和银行家的大量挫败感。


Put differently, what was once a virtuous loop has become a vicious loop that holds much of human attention trapped. Much of The World After Capital is about breaking  free of this vicious version of the job loop. That is an urgent problem as the job loop has been becoming more vicious for some time now due to a change in the relationship between labor and capital.

换句话说，曾经的良性循环已经成为一个恶性循环，将人类的大部分注意力困住。《资本之后的世界》的大部分内容是关于挣脱这种恶性的工作循环。这是一个紧迫的问题，因为一段时间以来，由于劳动和资本之间关系的变化，工作循环已经变得更加恶性。



## The Great Decoupling

To understand what is happening to the job loop, we need to look at a change in the economy that has become known as “the Great Decoupling” (Bernstein & Raman, 2015). In the decades after Worl War II, as the US economy grew, the share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) going to labor grew at the same rate. However, starting in the mid-1970s, GDP continued to grow while household income remained flat (Economic Policy Institute, n.d.).

Over this time of stagnant incomes, and particularly from the mid-1980s onward, US GDP growth was increasingly financed by consumers going into debt, until we reached the limit of how much debt households could support. The first event that really drove that point home was the collapse of the US housing bubble. There is some evidence that we are hitting another such point right now, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to dramatic increases in unemployment.

Similar changes have occurred in other developed economies. This decoupling may be partly accounted for by changing demographics, but the primary driver appears to be technology. As technological innovation accelerates, there will be further pressure on the job loop. Particularly worrisome is the fact that jobs in developing countries are highly exposed to automation (The Economist, 2016). As a result, these countries may either skip the “golden age of the job loop” entirely or have a much diminished version.

So, while we want to free up the attention trapped in the job loop, we need to figure out how to do so gradually, rather than through a rapid collapse. But is such a collapse even possible?


## Lump of Labor or Magic Employment Fallacy?

With the job loop still dominant, people have to sell their labor to earn a living. Until recently, most economists believed that when human labor is replaced by technology in one economic activity, it finds work in another part. These economists refer to a fear of technological unemployment or underemployment as the “lump of labor fallacy.“
 
The argument is that automating some part of the economy frees up labor to work on something else—entrepreneurs might use this newly available labor to deliver innovative new products and services, for example. There is no fixed “lump” of labor; rather there are potentially an infinite number of things to work on. After all, this is what has happened historically. Why should this time be different?
 
To understand how things could be different, we might consider the role horses have played in the American economy. As recently as 1915, 25 million horses worked in agriculture and transportation; by 1960, that number had declined to 3 million, and then we stopped keeping track entirely as horses became irrelevant (Kilby, 2007). This decline happened because we figured out how to build tractors, cars and tanks. There were just no uses left for which horses were superior to a mechanical substitute. The economist Wassily Leontief (1952) pointed out that the same thing could happen to humans in his article “Machines and Man”. 

Humans obviously have a broader range of skills than horses, which is why we have so far always found new employment. So what has changed? Basically, we’ve figured out how to have computers do lots of things that until recently we thought only humans could do, such as driving a car. Digital technology gives us universal computation at zero marginal cost. Suddenly, the idea that we humans might have fewer uses doesn’t seem quite so inconceivable. 

Those who claim that this is committing the lump of labor fallacy argue that we haven’t considered a new set of human activities that will employ people, but that line of thinking might also be flawed. Just because we have found new employment in the past doesn’t mean we will in the future. I call this belief the “magic employment fallacy.”

We can be incredibly creative when it comes to thinking of new things to spend our time on, but the operative question for people selling their labor is whether they can get paid enough to afford solutions to their needs, such as food, shelter and clothing. The only thing that matters for this question is whether a machine or another human is capable of doing whatever we think of more cheaply. 

This turns out to be the central problem with the magic employment fallacy. Nothing in economic theory says what the ‘market-clearing price’ for labor—the wage level at which there is neither unemployment nor a labor shortage—ought to be. It might be well below what people need to cover their needs, which could present a near-term existential threat to many people. 
We thus appear to face a dilemma. On the one hand, we want to free up human attention for uses that the job loop doesn’t provide for. On the other hand, we want to avoid a rapid collapse of the job loop. In order to understand how we can accomplish both, we need to consider the relationship between the cost of labor and innovation.


## Expensive Labor and Innovation

Some people argue that unions made labor expensive, resulting in unaffordable products and services. But in reality, increased labor costs in fact propelled us to become more efficient: entrepreneurs overcame the challenge of more expensive labor by building better machines that required fewer humans. In countries such as India, the abundance of cheap labor meant that for a long time there was little incentive to invest in machines, since it was cheaper to have people do the work by hand.

Globally, we face the risk of being stuck in a low innovation trap precisely as a result of a fear that automation will make labor cheap. For example, we might end up with many more years of people driving trucks across the country, long after a machine could do the same job more safely (Wong, 2016). What is the incentive to automate a job if you can get someone to do it for minimum wage? 

Some people object to automation innovations on the grounds that work is an integral part of people’s identity. If you have been a truck driver for many years, for instance, who will you be if you lose your job? At first, this might sound like a completely legitimate question. But it is worth recalling that the idea that purpose primarily has to do with one’s profession, instead of belonging to a religion or to a community, is an Industrial Age phenomenon.

If we want to free up attention via automation, we need to come up with new answers to these concerns. That will be the subject of Part Four, but before getting there we will first consider why capitalism by itself can’t solve these problems.
